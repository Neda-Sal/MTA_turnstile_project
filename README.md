# MTA_turnstile_project

Leveraged MTA Turnstile data to develop insights on the optimal stations in NYC to place volunteers who have the task of gathering as many signatures possible for a women in tech company gala.

The final recommendations were based on station traffic, stations in high income areas, and stations in areas with a high concentration of charitable donors.

# IRS Individal Tax Income Data
Leveraged zipcode data within IRS Tax Income reports to determine the subway stations in New York City in high-income, and highly charitable areas, where people are more likely to donate. This was to help allocate a non-profit organization's street team at subway stations where they can reach people most likely to attend the gala and donate.
