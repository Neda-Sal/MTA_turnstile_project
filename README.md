# MTA_turnstile_project

Leveraged MTA Turnstile data to develop insights on the optimal stations in NYC to place volunteers who have the task of gathering as many signatures possible for a women in tech company gala supporting.

The final recommendations were based on station traffic, stations in high income areas, and stations in areas with a high concentration of charitable donors.
